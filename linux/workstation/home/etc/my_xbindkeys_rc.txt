# This is Thad's custom xbindkeysrc file
# To start xbindkeys with this rc file: `xbindkeys --file <name of this file>`
#
# Note that xbindkeys tends to start on its own if file ~/.xbindkeysrc exists.
#   To get xbindkeys not to start on its own, any of the following ought to work:
#      #> Make it so that no ~/.xbindkeysrc file exists
#      #> Create a file ~/.xbindkeys.noauto (with no content in the file, not sure what hapens if it has content)
#

# The following configuration uses the `xinput set-button-map ...` action from my ~/bin/my_mouse_customization.sh
"/usr/bin/xte 'mouseclick 1' 'mouseclick 1' &"
   b:16 + Release

# end of file
